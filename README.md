# Machine-Learning

#### HomeWork 1
Use Naive Bayes and Decision Trees algorithm on given dataset. 

#### HomeWork 2
Use NN, SVM Radial, KNN, Linear Regression on given dataset.

#### HomeWork 3
Use  K-Means, H-Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Model	algorithms on two datasets.

#### HomeWork 4
Use NeuralNetwork, KNN, GradientBoosting, DecisionTreeGini, DecisionTreeEntropy, RandomForest on same data set and check the best model for given dataset.

Use K-Means, H-Clustering, GMM on same data set and check which is best model for clustering for given data set.
